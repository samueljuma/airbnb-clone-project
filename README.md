## üë• Team Roles

This project involves multiple roles that contribute to building and maintaining the backend system:

| Role                | Responsibility                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backend Developer**     | Builds the API endpoints, integrates business logic, ensures authentication and security mechanisms are properly implemented. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Designs the database schema, manages indexing and performance optimization, and ensures data integrity. |
| **DevOps Engineer**        | Sets up Docker environments, manages CI/CD pipelines, handles deployment and monitoring of the application. |
| **QA Engineer**            | Writes test cases, performs manual and automated testing to ensure the backend meets quality standards. |

| Technology       | Purpose                                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python**       | The primary programming language used for building the backend logic.                    |
| **Django**       | High-level web framework for handling routing, models, authentication, and admin.       |
| **Django REST Framework** | Simplifies building RESTful APIs with features like serializers and viewsets.         |
| **GraphQL**      | Enables flexible and efficient client-defined queries and mutations.                     |
| **PostgreSQL**   | Relational database used to store structured data like users, bookings, and listings.    |
| **JWT (SimpleJWT)** | Provides stateless, token-based authentication for securing API access.                |
| **Celery**       | Manages asynchronous tasks such as sending emails or processing payments.                |
| **Redis**        | Acts as a message broker for Celery and handles caching for improved performance.        |
| **Docker**       | Containers to isolate services and ensure consistent environments across machines.       |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Automates testing, building, and deployment processes for continuous delivery.         |

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

The backend system is designed around several core entities. Below is an overview of each entity, key fields, and relationships.

| Entity      | Key Fields                                             | Relationships                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**    | `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `is_host`          | A user can list multiple properties and make multiple bookings.                |
| **Property**| `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`     | A property belongs to one host (User) and can have multiple bookings/reviews. |
| **Booking** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out` | A booking is made by a user for a specific property.                          |
| **Review**  | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`   | A review is posted by a user for a specific property.                         |
| **Payment** | `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_method` | A payment is tied to a booking.                                               |
